		<p><font color="purple"><b>There exists the Maths Learning Centre (MLC) in Leonards S. Klinck (LSK) building, room 301 & 302.</b></font> There you will find an army of TA (between three to six) willing to help students with their doubts. Please, try the exercises by your own before going there since the demand for TA time is high, the time supplied from TA is relatively short per students (about ten to fifteen minutes). The MLC is a space for undergraduate students to study math together, with friendly support from tutors, who are graduate and upper-year undergraduate students in the math department. The MLC is located at LSK301 and LSK302 and is open 5 days a week from 11am-5pm. Every undergraduate student studying Math is welcome here!

			Here is the <a href="http://www.math.ubc.ca/~andrewr/CLP/clp_1_dc_home.html">course book</a> we are following.
			<ul>
				<li>Week 0. <font size="4", color="darkcyan">Chapter zero and Appendix A</font>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Sept 6th and 8th.</b> Birds-eye view of high-school topics.
				</ul>
				<li>Week 1. <font size="4", color="darkcyan">Chapter one, section from 1.1 until 1.5</font>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Sept 11th.</b> Notion of limit \(\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x) = L\). Definitions of Cost (C), Revenue (R), Price (p), Quantity (q) and Profit (P). Simple, compounded and continuously compounded interest.
					<li><b>Sept 13th.</b> Notions of the limit \(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L\) and of \(\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty\) and of lateral (or sided) limits \(\lim\limits_{x \to a^+} f(x) = L\) and \(\lim\limits_{x \to a^-} f(x) = L\). <em>Notice that these can be merged and so obtain, for example, the notion of \(\lim\limits_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \infty\).</em> Several examples of limits. <font color="red">There was a wrong derivation in previous class, please read and work the proposed exercised in the <a href="Simple_Compound_and_Continuously_compounded_interest.pdf">correct derivation.</a></font>
					<li><b>Sept 15th.</b> Definition of <em>Average rate of change.</em> The geometrical interpretation as a slope and examples.
				</ul>
				<li>Week 2. <font size="4", color="darkcyan">Chapter one, section 1.6. Chapter two, sections 2.1 until 2.3</font>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Sept 18th.</b> Notion of continuity and different types of discontinuities that we shall encounter: removable, jump, infinite and essential. Some examples, see section 1.6 in the <a href="http://www.math.ubc.ca/~andrewr/CLP/clp_1_dc_home.html">book.</a>
					<li><b>Sept 20th.</b> A typical business problem, the intermediate value theorem (IVT) in a geometrical version and several examples about it.
					<li><b>Sept 22nd.</b> Average rate of change revisited. The notion of tangent line using average rate of change.

				<ul>
					<li><b>Sept 25th.</b> The rules of differentiation for addition (or sum), product (or multiplication) and quotient (or division). Also, a differentiable function at a point is necessarily continuous there.
					<li><b>Sept 27th.</b> Problems with tangent lines with some twist. Examples of these include finding common tangent line to two curves, finding a tangent line with a given slope, finding a tangent line passing through some point (not in the curve), finding two different tangent lines that are parallel to each other and many more. <em><font color="red">I cannot stress out more that simple examples can quickly become very algebraically involved</font></em> (such as the one done today in class) and so, you need to practice.
					<li><b>Sept 29th.</b> Review with lots of <a href="ReviewFirstMidterm.pdf">practice problems</a>. <font color="red"><a href="PracticeProblemsRoughSolutions.pdf">Solutions sketch.</a></font>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li><b>Oct 2nd.</b> Chain rule: "the slope of the best linear approximation of the composition of two functions \(g \circ f\) is the slope of the composition of the corresponding best linear approximations, namely \((g \circ f)'(c) = g'(f(c)) f'(c)\)." Several examples.

				<ul>
					<li><b>Oct 16th.</b> Price elasticity of demand. <font color = "red">We didn't have time to revisit Continuously compounded interest, you should read the notes provided.</font>
					<li><b>Oct 18th.</b> Exponential-vs-polynomial growth and a first look at Ordinary Differential Equations.
					<li><b>Oct 20th.</b> Optimisation I. Fundamental <em>Extreme-value theorem:</em> a continuous function defined on a closed interval \(f:[a, b] \to \mathbb{R} \) attains its maximum and minimum, that is to say, there are two points (at least) \(x_1^*\) and \(x_2^*\) in \([a, b]\) with \(f(x_1^*) \leq f(x) \leq f(x_2^*)\) for all \(x \in [a, b]\). We also saw that if a continuous function \(f:[a, b] \to \mathbb{R}\) is also differentiable on \((a, b)\) then any extreme point (or optimiser, as I called them) \(x^* \in (a, b)\) will satisfy \(f'(x^*)=0\).
				</ul>
				<li>Week 7. <font size="4", color="darkcyan">Chapter three, section 3.5. I also wrote notes for the <a href="Extra_FirstOrderCriteria_MATHS_104_103_2017W.pdf">first order criteria.</a></font>

		<p><em><font size="5">Written Assignments (roughly biweekly).</font></em> All assignments are focused on <em>exposition of ideas</em> rather than on maths content (that is Webwork for). Short arguments should be given in the main steps of the solution. You don't need to make an essay out of the assignment, but <em>an assignment containing only formulae, even if they make sense, sall receive a mark of zero (0).</em><br />
			Please <b>remember</b> to write your <b>name</b> or preferred name and <b>student number.</b><br />
			<b>To pick up your assignments</b>, you will need to go to the MLC (see above for information of the MLC) with your <b>student ID</b> and two things: (1) under no circumstances you do not have the right to access the drawers where the assignments are guarded and (2) you cannot ask for other students' assignments, <em><font color="red">doing so would violate UBC Privacy Information Policy.</font></em>
